alt="Machine generated alternative text:&#10;Question: &#10;An electric dipole consists of two identical but opposite charges separated by a distance '2a. An electric dipole witn charges +4.60&quot;C and —4.60&quot;C and separated by a distance 824 pm &#10;is placed in a constant electric field E = 6.84 x 105i NIC. Initially the dipole is alinged along the j axis as shown in the figure. use unit vector notation to answer these questions. T ne k &#10;unit vector is out of the screen towards you. &#10;2a &#10;Figure 1 _ Two equal but opposite charges are placed a distance 2a apart in the y direction. In the x direction a constant electric field E is applied. &#10;part 1) &#10;What is the force on the +4.60gC charge at the instant shown? &#10;i + 10 &#10;part 2) &#10;What is the net torce on the dipole in this electric field? &#10;i + 10 &#10;part 3) &#10;What is the net torque on the dipole at the instant shown in the figure? &#10;j &#10;Nm "></p>
