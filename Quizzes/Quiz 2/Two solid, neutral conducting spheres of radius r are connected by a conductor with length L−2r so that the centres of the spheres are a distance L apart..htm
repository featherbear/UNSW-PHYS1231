It is a distance a trom the centre ottne sphere along the axis joining the two spheres as shown in the tigure_ &#10;a &#10;Figure 2. A charge -eq is placed a distance a from the sphere on the right and a + L from the sphere on the right. &#10;For this question assume that T a L. In this question use eo rather than Coulomb's constant in your expressions. Take the voltage an infinite distance trom a point charge to be zero, &#10;part 1) &#10;The charge +q will induce a negative charge, —Q, in the right hand sphere. What is the potential at the centre of the right hand sphere due to just this induced charge? &#10;part 2) &#10;Write an expression tor V in the centre of the right hand sphere accounting tor all the charges in the system. &#10;Vright &#10;part 3) &#10;using this expression, obtain an expression tor Q, the magnitude of the induced charge.
