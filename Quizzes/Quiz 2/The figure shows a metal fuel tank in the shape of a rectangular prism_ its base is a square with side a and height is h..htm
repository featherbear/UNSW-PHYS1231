alt="Machine generated alternative text:&#10;Question: &#10;The figure snows a metal fuel tank in the shape ot a rectangular prism: its base is a square witn side a and height is h. At a small distance d trom one side is a rectangular metal plate, dimensions &#10;a x h. It is red in the sketch and is almost touching the floor and the walls of the tank. The sketches are not to scale (in tact, d a ), so that the plate and the tank, when empty, constitute a &#10;simple parallel plate capacitor witn dimensions a by h and separation d, where edge effects may be neglected. Capillary ettects are also negligible. The second sketch snows the tank with a depth &#10;y otfuel, which has a dielectric constant K (Greek kappa, not k). Our plan is to use the capacitance beüeen plate and tankas a fuel gauge. (Hint: we can treat paäly filled capacitor as two &#10;capacitors.) &#10;d &#10;Tank &#10;h &#10;Fuel &#10;Figure 1 _ The left figure depicts an empty fuel tank. It has a square base, side a, and height h. A capacitor plate, size approximately a by h, is parallel to one wall, which is the other capacitor plate, &#10;at distance d away. Right figure depicts the fuel tank now paäially filled with fuel (yellow) up to a height y. This fills the capacitor to height y. &#10;part 1) &#10;In terms ot the variables named and any relevant constants, derive an expression tor the capacitance between the plate and the tank when the fuel reaches height y as shown. &#10;part 2) &#10;, where V is the volume of fuel in the tank. (Remember that d a so the volume of fuel in the capacitor is negligible compared &#10;Hence derive an expression for the sensitivity ot this fuel gauge, &#10;Witn that in the tank. &#10;part 3) &#10;Consider a tank witn side a — &#10;litre. &#10;Check &#10;27 cm, and height h &#10;PF /litre &#10;15 cm, with capacitance spacing d &#10;1.0 mm and containing kerosene with K &#10;1.8. Express the sensitivity of the gauge in picofarads per "></p>
