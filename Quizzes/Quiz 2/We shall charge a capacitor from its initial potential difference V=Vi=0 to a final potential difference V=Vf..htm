alt="Machine generated alternative text:&#10;Question: &#10;We shall charge a capacitor trom its initial potential difference V = Vi = 0 to a final potential difference V = Vf. &#10;part 1) &#10;How much work is done to add the first small amount ot charge dq to the capacitor (at Vi = 0) and now much work is done to add the last small* amount of charge dq to the capacitor (at V &#10;dWi &#10;dWf = &#10;(Incidentally, this question gives us some insight into the use ot calculus in the world. Here, dq is obviously not infinitesimal. The minimum charge transfer onto a capacitor is e, which is small, but &#10;not infinitesimal.) &#10;part 2) &#10;using the ideas in part 1 and the definition ot capacitance C, write an integral for the work done to charge the capacitor from uncharged to V = Vf. Your integral should be in terms of V and should &#10;not include dq. &#10;W = f OVf &#10;part 3) &#10;Hence write an expression for the potential energy stored on a capacitor with capacitance C charged to Vf. &#10;Part 4) &#10;Assume that the capacitor is a parallel plate capacitor with area A, plate separation d, negligible edge etfects and no dielectric. using your answer to pan 3), derive an expression for the energy per &#10;unit volume ot the vacuum between the plates. Give your answer in terms ottne electric tield E between the plates and do not include C in the expression; simplify it as much as possible. &#10;volume &#10;Check "></p>
